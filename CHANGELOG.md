## [0.21.8] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed & Improved
- **Interactive Controls & Retroactive Stage Editing in Overseas RMA Modal (`OverseasView.tsx`)**:
  - **Activated 'แก้ไขที่รายขั้น (กรอกย้อนหลัง)' Action Workflow**:
    - Wired an active `onClick` handler on the button to toggle into an interactive retroactive step-editing view across all 8 stages.
    - Added dedicated editing controls for each stage: stage status select (`completed`, `active`, `pending`), start date (`startDate`), end date (`endDate`), actual elapsed days (`actualDays`), and notes (`notes`).
    - Added "บันทึกข้อมูลย้อนหลัง" (Save) and "ยกเลิก" (Cancel) buttons with transactional persistence to database via `updateRma`.
  - **Interactive Native Date-Time Calendar Picker ('วันและเวลาที่เกิดขึ้นจริง')**:
    - Replaced static text input with an interactive `datetime-local` input backed by `actualDateTime` state and `dateTimeInputRef`.
    - Removed `pointer-events-none` blocking from the calendar icon button and wired it to `dateTimeInputRef.current.showPicker()` for instant calendar popup invocation.
    - Added real-time Thai display timestamp preview (`formatDisplayDateTime`).
  - **Dynamic Stage Transition Button Binding**:
    - Dynamically computed the primary stage transition button label based on the current stage and next stage (e.g. `› ปิดขั้น "จีน — ซ่อม" → เข้าขั้น "ขนส่งกลับ"`, or `› ปิดใบส่งซ่อม RMA (ของกลับถึงแล้ว)` for stage 8).
    - Coupled date-time capture to stage advance mutation, persisting updates directly to MongoDB / server persistent storage.
  - **Fixed Segmented Progress Count Badge**:
    - Replaced hardcoded `5/8` fallback with dynamic calculation `{item.currentStageNumber}/{item.totalStages}`.

## [0.21.7] - 2026-09-25

### Refactored & Purged
- **Purge All Mock Data & Fallback Fixtures**:
  - **Removed Hardcoded Mock Stores & Fallbacks**:
    - Purged `INITIAL_FALLBACK_TICKETS` from `useRealtimeDashboard.ts` and set dashboard initial state to pure computed metrics (`calculateDashboardMetrics([])` = 0) until API response arrives.
    - Purged `ASSETS` mock array baseline from `src/app/api/equipments/route.ts` and `src/hooks/useEquipmentsQuery.ts`; equipment query cache and fallbacks now start empty (`[]`) and bind strictly to live database records.
    - Purged `AVAILABLE_CASES` mock array and `(typeof ASSETS)[0]` type reference from `OverseasView.tsx`; linked claim case dropdowns now resolve dynamic live tickets and database equipments.
    - Purged `STATIONS` baseline fixture from `src/app/api/stations/route.ts`, `NewTicketView.tsx`, `TicketsView.tsx`, and `StationsView.tsx`; station lists and cascade filters now query exclusively from `/api/stations`.
  - **Clean Empty-State UI Views**:
    - Ensured every query reflects the true state of the database—when the database is empty (`[]` or `null`), the system cleanly renders authentic empty-state views (e.g., "ไม่พบข้อมูลอุปกรณ์", "ไม่พบเคสที่ตรงกับเงื่อนไขการค้นหา", "ไม่พบรายการส่งซ่อมต่างประเทศที่ตรงกับเงื่อนไข", "ไม่พบข้อมูลสถานีที่ค้นหา") rather than resurrecting static sample fixtures.
  - **Unified Real-Time Dashboard & SSE Pipeline**:
    - Updated `/api/realtime/stream` to integrate server-side persistent ticket storage fallback seamlessly with MongoDB Atlas for zero-latency metric broadcasting.

## [0.21.6] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed & Improved
- **Cross-Device & Cross-Browser Data Synchronization (`useRmaQuery`, `useRealtimeDashboard`, `useTicketsQuery`)**:
  - **Removed Browser-Specific Storage Dependencies**:
    - Eliminated `localStorage` (`getDeletedRmaIds`, `getDeletedTicketIds`, `getCustomTickets`, `addCustomTicket`, `addDeletedTicketId`, `addDeletedRmaId`) as an authority for data fetching across client machines, ensuring all devices fetch directly from the shared remote database without local state partitioning.
    - Updated `NewTicketView.tsx` to dispatch case creation exclusively to `/api/tickets` with automatic cache invalidation (`invalidateTicketsCache()`).
    - Updated `useRealtimeDashboard.ts` to compute metrics purely from server records (`/api/tickets` and `/api/dashboard/stats`) without mixing browser-local tickets.
  - **Eliminated Mock Fallback Resurrection in Overseas RMA**:
    - Created `src/data/rma.json` and `src/data/deleted_rma.json` server-side data files paired with `src/lib/storage/serverRmaStorage.ts` to guarantee durable persistence across Vercel serverless worker recycles.
    - Created unified `useRmaQuery` hook replacing local `INITIAL_RMA_ITEMS` and preventing stale mock lists from reappearing on external machines.
    - Wired `OverseasView.tsx` directly to `useRmaQuery` with optimistic updates and immediate database deletion.
  - **Strict No-Cache Headers & Dynamic Execution Enforced**:
    - Applied `NO_CACHE_HEADERS` (`Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=0, s-maxage=0`, `Pragma: no-cache`, `Expires: 0`, `Surrogate-Control: no-store`, `X-Accel-Buffering: no`) to all success and error responses (400, 404, 409, 500) across `/api/stations`, `/api/equipments`, `/api/tickets`, `/api/rma`, `/api/assets`, and `/api/dashboard/stats`.
    - Added `X-Accel-Buffering: no` to `next.config.ts` for all `/api/:path*` routes.
  - **Window Focus & Real-Time Cache Revalidation**:
    - Added `refetchOnWindowFocus` and `visibilitychange` listeners across all query hooks (`useEquipmentsQuery`, `useTicketsQuery`, `useRmaQuery`, `useRealtimeDashboard`, `useRealtimeSync`) to immediately re-sync data whenever a device/browser tab becomes active.

## [0.21.5] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed & Improved
- **Claim Table Deletion Persistence & Serverless Durability (`TicketsView` & `/api/tickets`)**:
  - **Real Database Deletion Mutation**: Connected the 'ลบ' (Delete) button to trigger an actual HTTP `DELETE /api/tickets?id=<ID>` call to MongoDB Atlas, releasing equipment locks (`status: "active"`), writing audit logs (`CLAIM_DELETED`), and preventing database rollback issues.
  - **Eliminated Mock Dataset Resurrection**: Removed hardcoded `INITIAL_TICKETS` from `TicketsView.tsx` and removed the flawed merge logic (`!apiTickets.some(...)`) that previously restored deleted tickets from initial mock state upon table reload or view switch.
  - **Persistent Server-Side Deletion Registry**: Created `src/lib/storage/serverTicketStorage.ts` with `deleted_tickets.json` to persist deleted ticket IDs across Vercel serverless worker recycles and cold starts.
  - **Shared Query Cache & Invalidation (`useTicketsQuery`)**:
    - Created unified `useTicketsQuery` hook providing optimistic updates, immediate rollback handling on network failure, and automatic cache invalidation (`invalidateTicketsCache()`) upon database confirmation.
    - Updated query response handling so reduced or empty lists from the backend are reflected directly into the cache without being overwritten by stale fallback data.
    - Added real-time window event listener (`caim:realtime:ticket`) to auto-remove deleted items across open tabs and windows.
  - **Optimistic UI & Dynamic Pagination Clean-up**:
    - Deleted rows disappear immediately from the table view with optimistic state transition.
    - Re-bound table rows mapping to `paginatedTickets` and wired dynamic footer controls: interactive rows-per-page selector (10, 20, 50), dynamic row count indicator (`แสดง X–Y จาก Z เคส`), and active previous/next page navigation buttons.


### Fixed & Improved
- **Anti-CDN & Browser Stale Caching Elimination (Vercel & Next.js)**:
  - Configured global `headers()` block in `next.config.ts` enforcing `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=0, s-maxage=0`, `Pragma: no-cache`, `Expires: 0`, and `Surrogate-Control: no-store` for all `/api/:path*` routes to disable aggressive Vercel Edge CDN caching.
  - Enforced `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`, `export const revalidate = 0`, and `export const fetchCache = "force-no-store"` across all API routes (`/api/equipments`, `/api/stations`, `/api/tickets`, `/api/rma`, `/api/assets`, `/api/dashboard/stats`, `/api/dashboard/stream`, `/api/realtime/stream`, `/api/realtime/sync-check`).
  - Added centralized `NO_CACHE_HEADERS` utility in `src/lib/constants/httpHeaders.ts` applied to all JSON responses.
- **Centralized Database State & Local Isolation Removal**:
  - Removed device-level `localStorage` partitioning (`CUSTOM_ASSETS`) from `useEquipmentsQuery.ts`, ensuring the centralized MongoDB Atlas database is the single source of truth across all clients and IP addresses.
  - Eliminated user-IP or session-based state divergence between different browsers and networks.
- **Real-Time Cross-Client & Cross-IP Synchronization**:
  - Upgraded `/api/realtime/stream` (SSE) to poll `caim.transaction_logs` every 2.5 seconds, bridging the serverless isolation gap between separate Vercel lambda instances and broadcasting all mutations across all connected IP addresses.
  - Implemented `/api/realtime/sync-check` lightweight delta-sync route querying MongoDB `transaction_logs` with `since` timestamp.
  - Enhanced `useRealtimeSync` hook with dual-channel sync (persistent SSE + 4s delta sync poller + visibility/focus revalidation), automatically invalidating client-side caches and triggering background refetching across all active sessions upon any user update.

## [0.21.3] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed & Improved
- **Equipment Registry Persistence & Data Integrity (`AssetsView` & `/api/equipments`)**:
  - **Permanent Multi-Tier Database & Disk Persistence**: Solved data loss on reload by implementing dual-layer persistence (MongoDB Atlas transactional collections `equipments`, `assets`, `transaction_logs` paired with persistent disk store `src/data/custom_equipments.json` and client-side `localStorage`), ensuring newly added devices are never lost even during network timeouts or worker recycles.
  - **Duplicate Serial Number Rejection**: Added pre-insert uniqueness validation returning HTTP 409 Conflict with clear Thai guidance if a duplicate serial number is submitted, preventing accidental overwrites that kept the count static.
  - **Dynamic Incrementing Total Counter**: Fixed total counter ('ทั้งหมด 644 รายการ') to dynamically increment upon adding a device (e.g. 644 -> 645) and retain the new count across page reloads and view changes.
  - **Permanent Top-of-Table Sorting**: Updated `/api/equipments` to sort query results by `{ createdAt: -1, updatedAt: -1, _id: -1 }` and configured optimistic updates to prepend at index 0, ensuring newly added equipment appears permanently at the top of the table list.
  - **Race-Condition & Stale-Cache Prevention in Query Hook (`useEquipmentsQuery`)**: Resolved in-flight fetch race condition where unawaited invalidations reverted newly added devices to stale cache. Pre-populated query cache from persistent store on mount and prevented fetch errors from purging custom records.
  - **Form Submission & Viewport Reset**: Updated `handleSaveDevice` in `AssetsView` to automatically clear active search queries/filters and reset pagination to page 1 upon creating an equipment so the new row at the top is immediately visible.

## [0.21.2] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed & Improved
- **Unified Equipment Query Hook & Shared Cache Invalidation (`useEquipmentsQuery`)**:
  - **Resolved 645 vs 644 Inconsistency**: Fixed isolated state and legacy `localStorage` discrepancy between `AssetsView` and `NewTicketView` by binding both components to a single authoritative source of truth.
  - **Unified Query Key & Cache Layer**: Created `useEquipmentsQuery` hook using shared query key `['equipments']` with reactive in-memory cache and automatic cache invalidation (`invalidateEquipmentsCache`).
  - **Automatic Database Synchronization**: Added auto-sync for any offline/local custom assets from browser storage to MongoDB Atlas on initial boot, ensuring all active records are unified.
  - **Bidirectional Dynamic Sync**: Bound dropdown list, counter badges, modals, and tables across both views to the same reactive state so mutations (create, update, delete) update all UI elements in real time.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed & Improved
- **Device Registry Dropdown & Action Link Synchronization (`NewTicketView`)**:
  - **Complete Device Registry Dropdown**: Removed hardcoded 50-item limit (`.slice(0, 50)`), now querying and displaying the complete equipment registry (all 644+ items) directly from database.
  - **Live Search & Autocomplete**: Upgraded real-time search across Serial Number, Vendor, Model, Device Name, and Description with clear button.
  - **Dynamic View-All Link & Registry Modal**: Made 'ดูทะเบียนอุปกรณ์ทั้งหมด' interactive with live dynamic count badge bound directly to database count (`equipments.length`), opening a full Equipment Registry Modal with search, filters, and 1-click equipment selection into the claim form.
  - **Real-Time Data Consistency**: Integrated `useRealtimeSync` hook into `NewTicketView` to ensure equipment creation, updates, and deletions immediately update the dropdown list and counter badge across all browser tabs without manual refresh.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-09-23

### Performance & Optimization
- **Image Payload Optimization**:
  - Re-encoded hero background image from uncompressed 5.36MB PNG to sharp high-res 2048px WebP (`IMG_8154_enhanced_2x.webp`) at 256KB (**95.2% size reduction**)
  - Enabled Next.js modern image formats (`image/avif`, `image/webp`) with long-term cache TTL
- **Persistent AppShell & Zero-Flicker Layout**:
  - Unified all authenticated pages (`/dashboard`, `/tickets`, `/tickets/new`, `/stations`, `/manual`, `/assets`, `/repairs/overseas`) under `(authenticated)` route group with shared `layout.tsx`
  - Completely eliminated unmount/remount layout thrashing and sidebar DOM reconstruction during page navigation
- **Rendering & Concurrency Optimization**:
  - Implemented `React.useDeferredValue` and `React.useMemo` for search filters in `StationsView`, `TicketsView`, and `AssetsView` to ensure 60fps responsive input with zero UI freezing
  - Hoisted static dataset allocations (`STATIONS`, `ASSETS`, `NAV_SECTIONS`) outside component bodies to eliminate repetitive memory allocation on re-render
- **Font & Asset Delivery**:
  - Pruned unused `Sarabun` 300 font weight from initial download pipeline, enabling `preload` and `display: "swap"`
- **Next.js & Turbopack Compiler**:
  - Added `compress: true`, `poweredByHeader: false`, and `optimizePackageImports` for `lucide-react`, `@base-ui/react`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge` (build time reduced by 74%)

- Moved the website inspection guide into the canonical skill's on-demand references

### Removed
- Expired sponsor integrations
- Japanese and Simplified Chinese READMEs; the English README is the single maintained entry point
- Redundant workflow diagrams from the READMEs
- Generated skill and instruction copies for unsupported or redundant agent platforms
- The agent-rule and skill synchronization scripts and their generated-file CI gate

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- Docker workflows for local development and multi-stage production builds
- Kiro support through a generated workspace `/clone-website` skill

- Improved multi-origin and query/fragment planning with collision-resistant output namespaces and explicit route verification
- Redesigned README onboarding around the template workflow, Opus 5 recommendation, supported platforms, and community links
- Hardened the rule and skill generators for current platform schemas and deterministic output

### Fixed
- Gemini CLI command validation by adding the required name and flattening the prompt schema
- Cline and Roo Code invocation, frontmatter, and argument handling
- Next.js documentation resolution in generated agent rules
- Vulnerable framework dependencies and generated-file consistency checks

### Removed
- Aider from the officially supported-platform list because its current capabilities cannot run the complete browser and subagent workflow reliably; `.aider.conf.yml` remains available for loading general project context
